## Introduction
This Spring Boot bug tracker web application is based on this
[couse](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/spring-fundamentals) with my personnal
improvements and modifications.

The main goal is to create a bug tracker web application and provide some
features like:

* User interface
* RESTful web service
* GraphQL interface
* Health monitoring and metrics
* Messaging with pub/sub applications

Technologies applied:

* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* Thymeleaf
* Spring Actuator
* GraphQL
* Apache Kafka
* PostgreSQL
* Docker

## What's already in place
* Very basic user interface
* RESTful web service
* GraphQL interface for the Applications
* Health monitoring and metrics

## What's next
* Static checking and pre-commit hooks
* Improve data model
* Create rich user interface
* Create consumers with Apache Kafka
* Improve tests
* Improve logging
* Dockerize everything
* Monitoring service's health from Docker
